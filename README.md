<b>My First Blog Project</b> 

 Welcome to the first blog webpage. The goal for this project was to build this webpage from scratch using HTML CSS and JavaScript and to develop a fully functioning webpage that will store the inputs of the current user who uses the webpage and apply the store inputs onto the page. The page also has fully functioning buttons that will allow you to maneuver through the pages and turn from light to dark. 

 This project provided excellent practice with DOM manipulation and demonstrate a little of what you can do with JavaScript and the power of for loops and JavaScript commands to get data and overwrite data on your webpage. At the beginning I was struggling but after pulling this off I now feel more comfortable with JavaScript and looking forward to further my learning in it.
